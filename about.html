        <p>
                I, Umar, am the kind of person who likes spending most of his writing codes and 
                designing web pages because without webpages there arent any accessible websites, right?
                I grew up in Nigeria in the North-Central region which is Kwara State. it's where i was born 
                and raised until i was well over 14 years old before i started learning Web Development. Am
                also the kind of person who likes to offer a hand to others. So feel free to contact me using my 
                contact info at the top of the page. But do not forget, I am the MAN
